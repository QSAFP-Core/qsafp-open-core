— A runtime accountability layer for the AI era.

## ✅ What the Community CAN Monetize (No License Required)
Open-core QSAFP functionality is intentionally liberating. You can:
- Build dashboards to visualize AI lifecycle metadata
- Offer consulting on AI model integrity using QSAFP logs
- Publish research papers or academic experiments
- Develop testing frameworks for internal governance
- Use core spec as a validation companion for enterprise AI audits

---

## 🛡️ Examples of Open Use
These examples fall safely under our permissive open-core:
- Internal runtime monitoring for private AI systems
- Academic validation of large language model boundaries
- NGO deployment to enhance public trust in algorithmic systems
- Public-sector agencies using the spec to enforce AI guardrails

---

## 🔒 Premium Features (Commercial License Required)
Premium use = embedding or monetizing QSAFP’s proprietary control logic or runtime verification mechanisms in paid tools, platforms, or AI stacks.

These features are protected under IP and offered via commercial agreements:
- **Quorum-bound runtime expiration:** Tamper-proof model lifespan enforcement
- **Quantum-random keypair gating:** Prevents unauthorized regeneration or runtime leaks
- **Multi-party lease renewal system:** Legal + technical checks for AI continuation
- **Kill-switch dashboard APIs:** Live shutdown with verified trail
- **Sovereign tenant isolation layer:** National/institutional AI deployments
- **Regulatory-grade compliance logging:** Immutable audit trails and proof-of-governance

💡 Why Pay?
- No other protocol offers quantum-grade enforcement of AI shutdown.
- Designed for sovereign adoption, not just corporate compliance.
- Protects reputations, systems, and lives. This is AI with consequence.
