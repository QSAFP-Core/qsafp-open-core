# QSAFP – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

_Last updated: July 25, 2025_

## ❓ What is QSAFP?

**QSAFP (Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol)** is a novel enforcement framework that prevents AI systems from operating outside authorized boundaries.

Rather than depending on “kill switches” or ethics checklists, QSAFP uses quantum-generated runtime keys, checkpoint validation, and strict session expiration to enforce real-world constraints.

---

## 🖥️ Is there a live demo?

Yes! You can explore our **interactive demonstration** here:  
🔗 [QSAFP Demo Walkthrough](demo.md)

The demo allows you to simulate:

- Key rotations and cryptographic attacks  
- Multi-party biometric validation  
- Session expiration and enforcement  
- Rogue AI bypass tests  

It reflects the architecture of the actual QSAFP protocol in a visual, interactive format.

## 🛠 What does "Open-Core" mean?

The open-core approach means:

- The **core architecture and basic enforcement specs** are public here on GitHub.
- The **more advanced enforcement logic** (e.g. quantum key rotation, embedded hardware enforcement) is reserved for founding or credentialed partners.

This model ensures transparency while protecting sensitive systems from misuse.

---

## 🔒 What makes QSAFP quantum-secured?

- Keys are generated using **quantum entropy** (via QKD or post-quantum randomness sources).
- Session expiration and checkpoints are bound to these keys.
- Tamper attempts or key spoofing can be tested directly in the demo.

## 🤝 Who can become a Founding Partner?

We are currently onboarding:

- National security agencies  
- Sovereign AI task forces  
- Responsible AI labs & think tanks  
- Quantum infrastructure specialists  
- AI hardware manufacturers

## 📜 What license is this project under?

The open-core files are released under [AGPL-3.0](../LICENSE.txt).  
This allows public collaboration, academic use, and proposal input—while preserving licensing protections for deeper components.

## 📂 Where should I start?

Start with:

- [README.md](../README.md) — Repo structure and navigation  
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) — Core enforcement logic  
- [docs/demo.md](demo.md) — Interactive UI explanation  
- [docs/overview.md](overview.md) — System summary

---

## 📬 Can I contribute without being a partner?

Yes!  
You can:

- Submit proposals or issues via [GitHub Issues](../../issues)  
- Fork and experiment with the open-core  
- Help improve docs or SDKs  
- Share QSAFP with AI safety communities
