# QSAFP Security Policy

## 🔐 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security is central to the QSAFP mission.  
If you identify a vulnerability or any exploitable behavior, we strongly encourage responsible disclosure.

## 📬 How to Report

Please email our core security team at:

📧 [security@bwrci.org](mailto:security@bwrci.org)

Include:
- Detailed description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Potential impact or affected components  
- Optional: your name or handle for credit

---

## ⏱ Response Timeline

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**  
- Assess and validate reported issues  
- Coordinate a resolution timeline  
- Credit contributors (if desired) in release notes or security acknowledgments

---

## 🔍 Scope of Coverage

This policy applies to:
- Code and logic in this open-core repository  
- Quantum key rotation, runtime expiration, validation interfaces  
- Demo behavior and SDKs (when released)  
- Governance, disclosure, or licensing vulnerabilities

Issues involving private Core+ systems may be redirected to secure review channels.

## 🧠 What Not to Do

To preserve system integrity:
- Do **not** exploit discovered vulnerabilities  
- Do **not** use automated denial-of-service tools  
- Do **not** attempt to access partner-locked systems without invitation

---

## 🤝 Recognition

We recognize and appreciate responsible researchers.  
Security contributors may be credited in changelogs, disclosures, or advisory updates upon request.
