## ✅ What the Community CAN Monetize (Open-Core, No License Required)  
These are fair game for anyone without a commercial license:  
- Consulting services for QSAFP **open-core** implementation  
- Training and certification programs  
- Managed hosting/deployment of open-core features  
- Complementary tools that **integrate with** (but don’t embed) QSAFP  
- Custom implementations using only **open-core components**  
- Internal use for research, non-profits, or government (not resold as a service)

## 🔒 What REQUIRES a Commercial License (Premium Enterprise Features)  
Embedding **any of the following premium modules** into a paid product/service requires a license or partnership:  
- **Quantum-grade enforcement of model shutdowns** (kill-switch as a feature)  
- **Federated trust + expiration chains** (cross-tenant governance & revocation)  
- **FinCEN-aligned logging & tamper-proof audit APIs**  
- **Enterprise-grade model governance dashboards**  
- **Integration with sovereign ID & national safety protocols**  
- **Quantum-secured model expiration or runtime constraints**  

**Concrete Examples:**  
- AI platforms offering QSAFP kill-switches as a paid add-on  
- SaaS tools embedding premium expiration/kill-chain features  
- Enterprise AI governance suites bundling premium logging APIs  
- National/sovereign deployments requiring identity-linked controls

## 🎯 Why Pay for Premium?  
- Enterprise-grade assurance with **quantum-secured enforcement**  
- Regulatory alignment (FinCEN, sovereign standards, tamper-proof logs)  
- Mission-critical dashboards for compliance & governance  
- Direct partnership support + roadmap influence

## 🤝 Partnership > Licensing  
We prefer **partnership models** (revenue-share, co-branded enterprise rollouts) over rigid licensing. Attribution is minimal but important. Talk to us early — we’re builder-friendly!
