# QSAFP Protocol Overview

**Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol (QSAFP)**  
_Enforcing Runtime Safety at the Edge of AGI_

---

## 🧠 Mission

QSAFP exists to enforce **provable human oversight** over frontier AI systems using cryptographically secure, runtime-bound mechanisms. It does not rely on trust, intent, or ethics frameworks — only on enforceable system logic.

This is achieved through:

- 🔐 Quantum-generated session keys  
- ⛓️ Immutable checkpoint sealing  
- 🛑 Provable runtime expiration  
- 🧭 Multi-party biometric consensus  

Explore these layers visually in our [interactive demo](demo.md).

## 🧬 Open-Core Structure

The repository provides a public open-core layer designed for transparency, education, and foundational pilots:

| Layer | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Protocol Architecture | ✅ Public | Runtime sealing, key rotation, expiration |
| Interactive Demo | ✅ Public | Simulated enforcement interface |
| SDK + Validator Tools | 🔜 Planned | Developer tools and wrappers |
| Hardware & Quantum Interfaces | 🔒 Private (Core+) | Embedded enforcement logic |
| Legal & Regulatory Modules | 🔒 Private (Core+) | Partner-restricted infrastructure |

## 🔁 Enforcement Summary

- **Quantum Key Management**: All sessions are tied to quantum-derived tokens with TTL (time-to-live) values.
- **Consensus Validation**: High-risk actions require consensus from independent biometric parties.
- **Bypass Detection**: Rogue AI simulations and boundary attacks are modeled and countered via sealed responses.
- **Expiration Enforcement**: Runtime is automatically invalidated when TTL expires unless renewed via consensus.

## 🛡 Use Cases

- Frontier model containment  
- AI safety protocol research  
- Government oversight architecture  
- Responsible AGI deployment testing  
- Zero-trust AI middleware
