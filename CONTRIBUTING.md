# Contributing to QSAFP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the open source components of QSAFP.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to create the global standard for AI safety through quantum-secured temporal boundaries. We believe AI systems should remain under meaningful human control as capabilities advance, and we're building the technology to make that possible.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **🐛 Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **✨ Feature Requests**: Suggest new capabilities for the open source components
- **📝 Documentation**: Improve guides, tutorials, and API documentation
- **🔧 Code Contributions**: Implement features, fix bugs, optimize performance
- **🧪 Testing**: Add test coverage, create integration tests
- **🎨 Examples**: Create integration examples for different AI frameworks
- **🌐 Translations**: Help localize documentation and interfaces

### What We Can't Accept

Please note that certain areas are not open for community contribution:

- **❌ Core Patent-Protected Algorithms**: Quantum key generation, hardware enforcement mechanisms
- **❌ Enterprise Features**: Multi-party verification network, compliance systems
- **❌ Security-Critical Components**: Cryptographic implementations, tamper detection
- **❌ Commercial Integrations**: Enterprise AI framework plugins, paid service features

## 🔒 Branch Protection Policy

To uphold the security and integrity of the open-core QSAFP repository, the `main` branch is protected by the following enforced rules:

- ✅ All changes must go through **Pull Requests (PRs)**
- ✅ Each PR requires at least **one approval**
- 🚫 **Direct commits** to `main` are blocked (even by maintainers)
- 🔒 **Force pushes and branch deletions** are disabled
- 👁️ Bypass privileges are limited to `Repository Admins` and select `Maintainers`

These policies ensure trusted contributions, maintain a clean history, and support auditability across critical QSAFP layers. They reflect our commitment to transparency, safety, and responsible stewardship of AI security tooling.

> 🛡️ These protections help ensure the QSAFP protocol remains trustworthy, secure, and under meaningful human control — in line with our mission.
