Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the open source components of QSAFP.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to create the global standard for AI safety through quantum-secured temporal boundaries. We believe AI systems should remain under meaningful human control as capabilities advance, and we're building the technology to make that possible.

- **🧪 Testing**: Add test coverage, create integration tests
- **🎨 Examples**: Create integration examples for different AI frameworks
- **🌐 Translations**: Help localize documentation and interfaces

### What We Can't Accept

Please note that certain areas are not open for community contribution:

- **❌ Core Patent-Protected Algorithms**: Quantum key generation, hardware enforcement mechanisms
- **❌ Enterprise Features**: Multi-party verification network, compliance systems
- **❌ Security-Critical Components**: Cryptographic implementations, tamper detection
- **❌ Commercial Integrations**: Enterprise AI framework plugins, paid service features
