QSAFP (Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol) is a cryptographic enforcement system designed to ensure runtime accountability for autonomous AI systems.  
It offers a robust, sovereign-grade fallback that safeguards national and enterprise infrastructure against catastrophic AI misalignment or external compromise.
