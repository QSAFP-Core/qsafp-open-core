# 🛡️ QSAFP – Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol

QSAFP (Quantum-Secured AI Fail-Safe Protocol) is a cryptographic enforcement system designed to ensure runtime accountability for autonomous AI systems.  
It offers a robust, sovereign-grade fallback that safeguards national and enterprise infrastructure against catastrophic AI misalignment or external compromise.

Currently leveraging Ephemeral Key Lease (EKL) as a pre-quantum placeholder, with QKD integration planned as infrastructure matures.

## 📜 Standards Submission Note (September 2025)

This repository includes the **reference implementation** of **QSAFP v2.1**, which has been submitted to the **NIST AI Standards Zero Draft Pilot** for consideration as a **hardware-embedded execution control overlay** aligned with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF).

**Purpose of this repo for standards reviewers:**
- Provide an **open-core proof-of-concept** for execution leases, quorum overrides, and cryptographic audit trails.  
- Enable **testing and feedback** from NIST, the AI Safety Institute (AISI), and global collaborators.  
- Support evaluation of QSAFP as a candidate overlay to strengthen the *Govern*, *Map*, and *Manage* functions in the AI RMF.  

**Important notes:**
- This repo demonstrates **core mechanisms only** (execution leases, timers, PQC signatures, integration scaffolding).  
- It is **not a production-ready security library**; hardware TEE, board-level controllers, and silicon IP integrations are roadmap items.  
- Contributions, issues, and test feedback are welcome.
- ### 🔬 Quick Test (5 Minutes)

For reviewers who want to see QSAFP in action:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/qsafp-core.git
cd qsafp-core/v2.1

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the demo (opens browser showcase)
npm run demo

## 📈 QSAFP v2.1 Performance & Observability

QSAFP v2.1 achieves **partnership-level performance targets** and now includes **granular per-provider latency logging** for transparent, verifiable benchmarks.

### ✅ Baseline Results (v2.1.0)
- **Safety Analysis:** <1ms average (deterministic pre-filter, regex/DFA triage)  
- **Multi-Provider Consensus:** ~660ms average (target: <1000ms)  
- **Threat Detection Accuracy:** 100% on baseline suite (9/9 prompts)  

### 🔍 New Observability Features
- **Per-Provider Timings:** Each provider call is individually timed and logged  
- **Consensus Elapsed Time:** Total consensus latency measured inside the engine  
- **Failure Diagnostics:** Rejected/errored providers are logged with error codes and response times  
- **Console Tables:** Results printed as clear, auditable tables during benchmarks
